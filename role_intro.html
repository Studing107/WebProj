                <h3>SpongeBob</h3>
                <p>The titular character and protagonist of SpongeBob SquarePants. He is a yellow rectangular sponge, whose body structure resembles that of a kitchen sponge. His birthday is July 14, 1986. He has two left hands, each with four fingers. His main outfit consists of brown shorts, a white shirt, and a red tie. He possesses immortality, as his body can recover from any damage. Although he eats normally, he can survive by filtering seawater. Despite his weak physical strength, he gains more strength as the series progresses.</p>

                    <p>A pink starfish with very low intelligence, his brain and body are connected by a plug. He is large and strong but often messes things up, although he is surprisingly good at driving. He lives under a large round rock. Lazy and childish, he often drools absentmindedly, hates bathing, and loves sleeping. His hobby is watching TV, especially enjoying the static screen. He has the best friendship with SpongeBob and often encourages him to take risky actions, which usually get them both into trouble.</p>

                    <p>A grumpy, self-centered octopus with a large nose who believes he is talented in art. He is bald but once had long yellow hair and wishes it would grow back. He lives in a house resembling an Easter Island head. He works as a cashier at the Krusty Krab but hates his job, enjoying playing the clarinet and painting self-portraits in various styles. He dislikes SpongeBob and Patrick (especially the former) but occasionally agrees with SpongeBob when it benefits him.</p>

                    <h3>Mr. Krabs</h3>
                    <p>A red crab whose real name is Eugene Krabs. He is known as "Armor Abs Krabs" from his time in the navy. He treats money as his life and often risks his life for a single dollar. He is extremely selfish. The owner of the fast-food restaurant "Krusty Krab," he frequently teaches his employees the importance of punctuality, as "time is money." Whenever he finds a product that can bring quick profits, he shifts focus from the beloved Krabby Patty to that product. He spends his office hours reading newspapers, counting money, and taking money baths. He enjoys watching satirical dramas and is the arch-nemesis of Plankton.</p>

                    <h3>Gary</h3>
                    <p>SpongeBob's pet snail, who can only meow like a cat. He has the ability to understand and communicate in natural language. Although he is a snail, he occasionally wears shoes, so he has hidden feet; he even taught SpongeBob how to tie his shoes. The inner shell hides some of SpongeBob's items: Gary's photos, a clock for meals, and mucus. The outer shell is equipped with a parachute mechanism. If something gets stuck on the bottom, he becomes uncomfortable and bites. He hates bathing. In dreams, he can use natural language to communicate and is even smarter than SpongeBob, being a philosopher.</p>

                    <h3>Sandy</h3>
                    <p>A female squirrel from Texas, who is a scientist, explorer, and inventor. She loves sports (especially karate and sandboarding) and science, and is also a rodeo champion. Since squirrels are land animals and need to breathe air, she wears a spacesuit and helmet underwater. She usually lives in a large circular reinforced glass dome under the sea, with an interior environment that mimics the land and can change seasons; if sea creatures enter, they need to wear helmets filled with water. She needs to hibernate, during which she becomes very irritable.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Krabs' nemesis and the main antagonist of SpongeBob SquarePants. Composed of 1% evil and 99% hot gas. He only has one eye, which often hurts because he forgets to blink. He owns the fast-food restaurant "Chum Bucket". His wife is a computer named Karen. To make his restaurant business thrive, he continuously tries to steal the secret formula for the Krabby Patty from the Krusty Krab but has never succeeded. His greatest ambition is to rule the world.</p>
